- A test Discord server

### Setting Up Development Environment

   cd defalt
   ```

2. **Set up configuration**

   # Edit appsettings.json with your test bot token and server IDs
   ```

3. **Build and run**

   ```

### Code Style

- Follow standard C# conventions
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add XML documentation for public methods
- Keep methods focused and single-purpose
- Use async/await properly for asynchronous operations

### Commit Messages

- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
